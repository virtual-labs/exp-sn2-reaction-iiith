1. An energy slider and structure of each molecule is present in the simulation's table.
2. Adjust relative energy for each molecule present in Reactants, Transition State and Products, such that you obtain an ideal state vs energy plot.
3. Note down these relative values, and compare it with actual values.
4. Use mouse/touch to interact with molecule, by rotating, and zooming around it.
5. For detailed logs, you can download gaussian files and analyze the data.
