These mechanisms depends on structure of the reactant and nucleiphile, the solvent, temperature. SN2: Let's consider transition state in the reaction between iodomethane and chloride ion.

By applying Newton's second law for rotational systems, the equation of motion for the pendulum may be obtained.

In the above substitution reaction, the nucleophile Cl- attacks the reactant iodomethane and forms a product chloromethane and leaves I- as leaving group. The intermediatary state where nucleophile Cl- forms bond and I- breaks bond with the iodomethane simultaneously is known as transition state.This mechanism is known as SN2 type and which is stereospecific i.e. Gives a product inverse in configuration with the reactant. Usually aprotic solvents like acetone, DMSO, DMF etc favours this reaction.
